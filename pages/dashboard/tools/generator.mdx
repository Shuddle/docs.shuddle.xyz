## Introduction

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to configure the generator for your project. This tool allows your users to create characters by combining various elements. They can download these characters or use them in the editor or other creations.

    width: "640",
    playerVars: {
      autoplay: 0,
    },
  }}
/>

## Find the generator configuration page

First up, let's connect to your admin dashboard. Navigate to your project, access the manage page, and then click on the generator tab.

The generator works on a layered system, similar to how NFTs work, where each layer represents a part of your character. To bring your character to life, you'll need to overlay multiple layers.

## Create your first layer

### Available options

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Option</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Default value</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Name</td>
      <td>Name of the category</td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Order of render</td>
      <td>Layer's depth (lower values mean closer to the back)</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>User can choose</td>
      <td>Is it updatable by user</td>
      <td>True</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>User can randomize</td>
      <td>User can randomize the choice</td>
      <td>True</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Transparent option</td>
      <td>Possibilty to have a "non"-choice where user can select "None"</td>
      <td>True</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Process to create a layer

Let's set up your first layer! Click on `Add category` to begin.

![add_category](/images/dashboard/tools/generator/add_category.png)

Fill in the name, and let's tweak a few settings before we create it. The `Order of Render` determines the layer's depth; lower values mean closer to the back. If it's our base layer, you can keep it at 1. Disabling or enabling `User can choose`, will allow the user to choose the layer. `User can choose` will allow users to randomly select this category when he press the 'randomize' button. `Transparent option` create a "None" option in the category. Confirm yours settings, and your category is ready.

Now, let's add the asset for the head by clicking the + button. You can delete it if necessary by clicking the trash icon.

## Set layer as default

You can press the star icon to set the layer as the default. This means that when the user opens the generator, this layer will be pre-selected.

## Saving and testing

After setting up everything, click `Save changes` at the bottom of the screen. Then, you can open your project page from the sidebar to see your live project. Go ahead and select the generator tool. Congratulations, you can now play around with your character and see the magic happen!
